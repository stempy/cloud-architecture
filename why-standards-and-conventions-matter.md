# Why Standards, Conventions and Automation Matters

One of the most important aspects for scalable software development are standards and conventions.

Things like coding conventions, best practices, design patterns, methodologies and guidelines, industry standards form structure that can be applied and repeated across people, teams and projects in a *consistent* way.

some common responses when it comes to applying standards:

- *"my programs work, and are super clever"*
- *"we have delivery deadlines we need to reach, we dont have time for fluff"*
- *"that wont work with our systems"*
- *"we will get around to that sometime, its in the pipeline"*
- *"we will have to change how we work"*

Not realizing that those patterns are effectively making things harder for themselves in the long term.

Software development has been around for sometime, and while there is many creative avenues it provides, there are many components that form foundational structure of a platform or boilerplate concepts. Hundreds, thousands of very smart people working together to try and improve the the software development processes.

When you first start developing a software application of any kind, and you are the only one working on it, often there can be a lot of experimenting, you want to try different things, some ideas, and concepts. You want to be creative and design the system how you see fit. And for small simple applications that a lone developer will work on, this may be fine. Ok, now how long do you intend to maintain this application? 1 month, 6 months, or longer.... perhaps years.... do other people need to work on this application at some point in the future? do you need to update it to newer versions of the platforms/frameworks as they are released?

From my own experience, I have been the sole developer of desktop and web applications that have been used by the public for several years, one particular desktop application that ran 24/7, I maintained for about 5 years alongside other projects. I have also architectured libraries and applications for other developers to work off... If I had just gone about my way creating things how I saw fit, ignoring common standards and approaches, it would have delayed projects and timelines, as developers would need to be trained or guided with *my* specific implementations. I would need to provide documentation and support for however long it existed. It would also be much harder to update to newer versions of the platforms, as there is the migration from version to version, also including all the custom non-standardized approaches to contend with. It provides an unnessacary pain point amongst developers as they won't be able to find any community provided documentation on a particular implementation. Developers are also users of what I produce.

As developers we love to experiment, as engineers/architects we have to create systems, processes and methods that can be repeated with consistent results. We will have multiple people working on projects, now if everyone has their own idea about how to go about doing things, than things can become scrambled very quickly. This is why standards are needed, in particular industry standards, developed by people in the field, that know what they are doing.
